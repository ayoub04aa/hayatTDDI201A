				<h2>London green program</h2>
				<pre><span>The Landon Hotel-London</span> was recently renovated, and we considered the impact on 
the earth the entire way. From green building materials, to solar power, to energy-friendly
lighting and appliances throughout the hotel - we're saving energy in every socket, outlet,
and switch. We've also initialed a recycling and composting program that reduces the
load to local landfils, while providing valuable raw material for use in new products, or in
the case of compost, for use in local gardens and landscapes.</pre>
